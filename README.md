## BlockchainGo

BlockchainGo is a simple implementation of the Blockchain technology in Go language. This project was build to learn more about the Blockchain technology and its features. The code was written with some comments in a way that can maybe help understand the most complicated parts. The code is also very direct, I didn't try to reinvent the wheel, just implement some of the Blockchain features.

I will be adding more features to this project in the future. See [Updates](#updates) section for more details.

#### Disclaimer

Like i said before, this project was built for learning purposes. It is not a production ready code. It is not secure or optimized and probably was not written in the best way.
